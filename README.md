# MicroAI-GUI-Dashboard
A GUI Dashboard created to visualize the output of the Micro AI AtomML SDK (Available on their Github Page). To view the GUI, the program will need to run on a device also running Micro AI's AtomML SDK.


This program requires the following external libraries:
* tkinter

* matplotlib

Users can change Sensor names and overall GUI look and feel within the GUI_Code folder using Dashboard.py file itself.
