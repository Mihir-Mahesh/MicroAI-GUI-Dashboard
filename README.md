# MicroAI-GUI-Dashboard
A GUI Dashboard created using the Micro AI Github Repository


Along with the Micro AI Github repository, this porgram works with external libraries. 

The libraries that need to be installed include:
* tkinter
* tkinter.ttk
* turtle
* matplotlib
* matplotlib.pyplot
* matplotlib.backends.backend_tkagg
* matplotlib.figure
* matplotlib.animation
* random
* PIL
* time
* redis
* datetime


The program will need to run alongside Micro AI's AI-Analytics, AIengine, and a form of their X-Code that inputs into redis.


Finally, the pictures that are included with the code will need to be downloaded and the code must be configured to point to these pictures.
